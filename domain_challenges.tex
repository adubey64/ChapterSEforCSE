\begin{itemize}
\item diverse algorithms - different data layout needs
\item less logical complexity more numerical complexity - hard to achieve data locality 
\item robustness and stability as important as accuracy
\item physics is messy - encapsulation can be challenging
\item unit testing insufficient, not even always possible
\item integrated and system level testing very critical
\item performance portability important
\item no replication of expertise and great depth in expertise is needed at times
\end{itemize}
