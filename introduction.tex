\label{sec:introduction}
Computational science and engineering (CSE) communities develop complex applications to solve scientific and engineering challenges, but these communities have a have a mixed record of using software engineering best
practices. Many codes developed by CSE communities adopt standard software practices only when the size and complexity of an appellation becomes too unwieldy to continue without them.  (KA NOTE: NEED REF) 
As more codes cross the threshold into increasing complexity, software engineering processes are being adopted from practices derived outside of the scientific and engineering domain.  The driving force behind adoption is usually the realization
that without using software engineering practices, the development,
verification and maintenance of appliations becomes
intractable. State-of-the-art for software engineering
practices in CSE codes lags behind that in the commercial software
space. (KA NOTE: Do we have any reference for this claim?) There are many reasons for it, first, is that
not all software engineering practices can actually be adopted by the CSE code
developers.  Secondly, there is often little funding for code development and maintenance. And finally, there is very little research in the software
engineering community targeted to specific needs of CSE codes.

Many software best practices are not well-suited for CSE codes without
modification and/or customization, in particular to multiphysics
multicomponents codes that run on the large HPC platforms. Sometimes
the inherent physics of scientific applications require different
software methodologies, at others a premium is placed on
performance rather than code architecture.  Still others are more
sociological and due to the type of institutions where such codes are
developed. The challenges for scientific applications range
from their architecture to the process for their maintenance and
growth. The standard practices adopted by the CSE codes include
repositories for code version control, modular code design, licensing
process, regular testing, documentation, release and distribution
policies and contribution policies. Less frequently used practices
include code-review and code-depracation. Agile developmenet methods
tend to have limited usefulness in the CSE lifecycle, only a
select subset of those have met with success. The degree of adoption and
sophistication in using these  practices varies among teams. Many of
the reasons behind less penetration are discussed in section
\ref{sec:institutional-challenges}. Even among the widely adopted
practices, most are modified and customized by the developers for
their own needs. The next two sections outline the  challenges that
are either unique to, or are more dominant in this domain than
elsewhere.
