\label{sec:introduction}
Computational science and engineering (CSE) communities develop
complex applications to solve scientific and engineering challenges,
but these communities have a mixed record of using software
engineering best practices. Many codes developed by CSE communities
adopt standard software practices when the size and complexity of an
application becomes too unwieldy to continue without them
\cite{cc2012}. The driving force behind adoption is usually the
realization that without using software engineering practices, the
development, the verification and the maintenance of applications can become
intractable. As more codes cross the threshold into increasing
complexity, software engineering processes are being adopted from
practices derived outside of the scientific and engineering domain.
State-of-the-art for software engineering practices in CSE codes often lags
behind that in the commercial software space.

There are many reasons for it, first, is
that not all software engineering practices can actually be adopted by
the CSE code developers.  Secondly, there is often little funding for
code development and maintenance. And finally, there is very little
research in the software engineering community targeted to specific
needs of CSE codes. 

Many software best practices are not well-suited for CSE codes without
modification and/or customization.  In particular, multiphysics and
multicomponents codes that run on the large High Performance Computing
(HPC) platforms have specific requirements.  In some cases, the
inherent physics of scientific applications require different software
methodologies.  In other cases, a large premium is placed on
performance, rather than code architecture, making it necessary to
sacrifice some known software engineering best practices.  Still
others are more sociological because codes may be developed by domain
scientists and their graduate students who have different priorities
and scientific goals.

The challenges in developing scientific and engineering applications range
from data dependencies, to architectural trade-offs, to the process for their maintenance and
growth.

The standard practices adopted by the CSE codes include
repositories for code version control, modular code design, licensing
process, regular testing, documentation, release and distribution
policies, and contribution policies. Less frequently used practices
include code-review, code-deprecation, and adoption of development
methodologies such as Agile \cite{agile}.

The degree of adoption and
sophistication in using software engineering practices varies among teams. Many of
the reasons for lower penetration of more formal software engineering practices are discussed in section
\ref{sec:instChallenges}. Even among the widely adopted
practices, most are modified and customized by the developers for
their own needs. The next few sections outline the challenges that
are either unique to, or are more dominant in this domain than
elsewhere.
