\begin{itemize}
\item resources are rarely available for software infrastructure - carved out of scientific goal oriented funding
\item consumers of the software on short term deadlines
\item concepts learned on the job
\item organic growth of codes - difficult to impose structure on existing codes
\item no replication of expertise and great depth in expertise is
  needed at times
\item transient population, minimal institutional support
\end{itemize}
