% \begin{abstract}
% Multiphysics multicomponent scientific codes have increasingly been 
% adopting software processes derived from outside the scientific
% domain. The driving force behind adoption is usually the realization
% that without using software engineering practices, the development,
% verification and maintenance of code becomes intractable. However,
% many software best practices need modification and/or customization.
% Sometimes the inherent physics of scientific applications require
% different software methodologies, while other times a premium is
% placed on performance rather than architecture.  Still others are more
% sociological and due to the type of institutions that are the typical
% homes for such codes. The challenges for scientific applications range
% from their architecture to the process for their maintenance and
% growth. For example, sometimes modularity and encapsulation principles
% are challenged by the need to tightly couple physics solvers to data
% structures.  Scientific codes are designed to explore phenomena that
% are not very well understood, so their verification strategies have to
% be customized. % The components of scientific codes must also consider
% % accuracy and stability, and interoperability between components must not
% % violate physical constraints. These constraints are particularly challenging for
% % numerical software because a wrong answer may not be detected to be wrong
% % because of the exploratory nature of the problems being addressed.  Finally, as
% % the research in the field evolves, codes may have to undergo radical
% % changes in base algorithms to include the newly acquired knowledge. And
% % the metrics of success are harder to define. 
% The institutional challenges in developing and maintaining scientific codes arise because the 
% research institutions in which they are developed often have an unreliable
% funding model and a transient developer population of graduate
% students. 
% % There are
% % rarely enough resources  to have any redundancy in expertise which makes
% % procedures like code review difficult. 
% Intellectual ownership, code 
% distribution, attribution of credit and contribution policies can all
% become thorny issues because there is often a lack of communication
% and sometimes even distrust among the stakeholders. 
% % Documentation
% % takes on a different kind of urgency because of transient expertise,
% % and yet it is notoriously difficult to persuade the 
% % developers in the field to spend their limited time providing
% % exhaustive documentation. 
% We elaborate on the above challenges and
% how they were addressed in FLASH, a code that has been extremely
% successful as a community code for several research communities. We
% outline specific solutions used by FLASH, and discuss their possible
% generalizations that are usable by other similar software 
% efforts. In particular, we address the issues related to software
% architecture and modularization, design of a testing regime,
% unique documentation needs and challenges, use of versioning system 
% for managing projects, and the tension between intellectual property
% management and open science.
